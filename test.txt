7.Common problems and solutions
Device cannot be connected to PLC or computer
possible reason:
1) The computer has multiple COM ports, and the selected port is incorrect.
2) The device address is wrong, or there are devices with duplicate addresses (the factory default is all 1).
3) Baud rate, check mode, data bit, stop bit error.
4) The host's polling interval and waiting time for answering are too short, and both need to be set above 200ms.
5) The 485 bus is disconnected, or the A and B lines are reversed.
6) If the number of devices is too large or the wiring is too long, power should be supplied nearby, and a 485 booster should be added, and 120Ω terminal resistance should be added at the same time.
7) The USB to 485 driver is not installed or damaged.
8) The equipment is damaged.
