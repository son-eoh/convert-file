1.Product Brief
1.1product description
RS-MG111-1 is an air environment comprehensive index monitor independently
developed by our company for detecting PM2.5, PM10, temperature, humidity,
air pressure, light, TVOC, O2, carbon dioxide (CO2), Carbon monoxide (CO),
formaldehyde (CH2O) and other parameters are very powerful and basically
cover various indicators that reflect air quality. The transmitter uses
imported sensors and arithmetic chips, with high precision, high resolution
and good stability. Widely used in building HVAC, building energy saving,
smart home, schools, hospitals, airport stations and other places.
1.2Features
1. It integrates a variety of measurement elements into one, with powerful
functions.
2. The temperature and humidity measurement unit is imported from
Switzerland, and the measurement is accurate.
3. PM2.5 and PM10 are collected at the same time, range: 0-1000ug / m3,
resolution 1ug / m3, unique dual-frequency data collection and automatic
calibration technology, consistency can reach ± 10%.
4. The gas unit uses electrochemical and catalytic combustion sensors with
excellent sensitivity and repeat ability.
5. The TVOC measuring unit adopts foreign imported high-sensitivity gas
detection probes. The technology is mature, and the high-performance signal
acquisition circuit is used. The signal is stable and the accuracy is high.
6. Wide range 0-120Kpa air pressure range, can be applied to various
altitudes.
7. Adopt special 485 circuit, the communication is stable, and the power
supply is within 10 ~ 30V wide voltage range.

    ①, select the correct COM port ("COM"-"Properties-Device Manager-Port"
    to view the COM port), the following figure lists the driver names of
    several different 485 converters.
                                    [pic]
②, only connect one device and power on, click the test baud rate of the
software, the software will test the current device baud rate and address,
the default baud rate is 4800bit / s, the default address is 0x01.
③ Modify the address and baud rate according to the needs of use, and at
the same time, you can query the current functional status of the device.
④ If the test is unsuccessful, please recheck the device wiring and 485
driver installation.
⑤ Click on the corresponding gas to directly view the current real-time
value of the gas.
⑥ Note: This software can only set three baud rates of 2400bit / s, 4800bit
/ s and 9600bit / s.

6.2Data frame format definition
Using Modbus-RTU communication protocol, the format is as follows:
Time for initial structure ≥ 4 bytes
Address code = 1 byte
Function code = 1 byte
Data area = N bytes
Error check = 16-bit CRC code
End structure ≥ 4 bytes of time
Address code: the address of the transmitter, which is unique in the
communication network (factory default 0x01).
Function code: the instruction function instruction issued by the host,
this transmitter only uses the function code 0x03 (read register data).
Data area: The data area is specific communication data, pay attention to
the high byte of 16bits data first!
CRC code: two-byte check code.

7.Common problems and solutions
Device cannot be connected to PLC or computer
possible reason:
1) The computer has multiple COM ports, and the selected port is incorrect.
2) The device  address  is  wrong,  or  there  are  devices  with  duplicate
addresses (the factory default is all 1).
3) Baud rate, check mode, data bit, stop bit error.
4) The host's polling interval  and  waiting  time  for  answering  are  too
short, and both need to be set above 200ms.
5) The 485 bus is disconnected, or the A and B lines are reversed.
6) If the number of devices is too large or the wiring is  too  long,  power
should be supplied nearby, and a 485  booster  should  be  added,  and  120Ω
terminal resistance should be added at the same time.
7) The USB to 485 driver is not installed or damaged.
8) The equipment is damaged.
